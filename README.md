///////////////////////////// [Please Consider My Issue] ////////////////////////////////////////////

I submitted my assignment on time last night, but for deploy problem my assignment wasn't submitted 
properly. 
My on-time submission netlify link on [https://604a59de2a42ad0fbe17d2d2--dazzling-allen-691820.netlify.app/] 
It is not working.
but my github link is ok [https://github.com/Porgramming-Hero-web-course/react-router-mehadiHasanDiner]

My Correct active Netlify Link is this one: [https://nifty-pare-d23f36.netlify.app/]

I don't want to resubmit my Netlify assignment Link for 5 marks deduction problem.
I submitted last all seven assignments on-time. Please allow my assignment as 50 marks criteria for 2nd day submission. Please don't deduct 5 marks for resubmission.
